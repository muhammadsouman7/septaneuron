# Septaneuron Flask conversion

This project converts the available React/Vite page structure into Flask and Jinja templates while preserving the original Septaneuron visual system.

## Structure.

## Conversion behavior

The page markup was preserved in the generated Jinja templates. Shared layout is provided by `base.html`, `navbar.html`, and `footer.html`. The original dock-style navbar, hero canvas, footer structure, page ambient layers, page CSS, and animation scripts were restored from the supplied Septaneuron source reference. CSS and JavaScript are served through Flask's `url_for('static', filename=...)` helper.

The supplied source did not include the original font binary in the mounted workspace, so the footer will use the configured fallback font until `Ethnocentric-Regular.otf` is copied into `static/assets/fonts/`. The Septaneuron SVG logo is included at `static/assets/imgs/svgLogo/septaneuron.svg`.
